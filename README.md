<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This project is a learning platform for students and teachers. The application allows you to view all courses in a tree structure (along with related groups and students). In addition, it is possible to create, edit, and delete courses, groups, students, and teachers. It is worth adding that the program provides a convenient user interface that synchronizes different windows when creating a particular entity in the user interface. In addition, the application works with a database, the connection string to which is located in the appsetting.json file. Finally, the program provides the ability to import group students from a csv file and export to it, as well as other formats, including pdf and docx.

1. View courses, groups, and students in a tree structure:
![Overview](<ReadmeImages/Overview.png>)

2. View individual courses, groups, students, and teachers (similar pages for other entities):
![Groups](<ReadmeImages/Groups.png>)

3. Each of the entities has three main actions: create, update and delete (similar form for updating):
![Create group](<ReadmeImages/Create group.png>)
![Create course](<ReadmeImages/Create course.png>)
![Create student](<ReadmeImages/Create student.png>)
![Create teacher](<ReadmeImages/Create teacher.png>)

4. Ability to perform additional actions with groups:
![Group action](<ReadmeImages/Group action.png>)

5. Export to csv, docx and pdf formats (photos in the appropriate order)
![Export into csv](<ReadmeImages/Export into csv.png>)
![Export into docx](<ReadmeImages/Export into docx.png>)
![Export into pdf](<ReadmeImages/Export into pdf.png>)
